Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.
$var1 = get-random -minumum 25 -maximum 50

Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.

$var2 = 5
Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.

$sum = $var1 + $var2
Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.

$sub = $var1 - $var2
Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.

$prod = $var1 * $var2
Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.

$quo = $var1 / $var2

Replace the variables in the following format:
"45" + "5" = "50"

write-host "$var1 + $var2 = $sum"

Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:
"45" - "5" = "40"

"$var1 - $var2 = $sub"

Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:
"45" * "5" = "225"

"$var1 * $var2 = $prod"



Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:
"45" / "5" = "quo"

"$var1 / $var2 = $quo"
